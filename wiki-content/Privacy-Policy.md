# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: January 2025_

## Overview

VoiceFlow is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our data practices for the VoiceFlow mobile application.

## Key Privacy Principles

### ðŸ”’ Local-First Architecture

All your data stays on your device. VoiceFlow has no backend servers and does not collect, store, or transmit your personal data to any servers controlled by us.

### ðŸ”‘ Your API Keys, Your Control

- You provide and manage your own API keys for third-party services
- API keys are stored locally on your device using secure storage
- We never have access to your API keys

### ðŸ“¡ Direct API Communication

When you use VoiceFlow, your device communicates directly with the third-party API providers you've configured (OpenAI, Google, etc.). We do not proxy or intercept these communications.

## Data Collection

### What We Don't Collect

- Usage analytics
- Voice recordings
- Transcribed text

### Important Notice

When you use these services through VoiceFlow:

### Your Responsibilities
