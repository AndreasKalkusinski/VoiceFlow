# Security Policy

## üîí VoiceFlow Security Model

VoiceFlow is designed with security and privacy at its core:

### Architecture

- **No Backend**: No servers to hack
- **Local Storage**: All data stays on device
- **Direct API Calls**: No middleman servers
- **Open Source**: Fully auditable code

### Data Protection

- API keys stored in device keychain (iOS) / encrypted storage (Android)
- Audio files deleted immediately after processing
- No telemetry or analytics
- No user tracking

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### For Contributors:

- **Never log API keys** or sensitive data
- **Use HTTPS only** for API calls
- **Sanitize user inputs** before API calls
- **Keep dependencies updated**
- **No hardcoded secrets**
