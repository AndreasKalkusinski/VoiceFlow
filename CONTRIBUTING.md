## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/VoiceFlow.git`
3. Add the upstream remote: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/VoiceFlow.git`
4. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI: `npm install -g expo-cli`
- iOS Simulator (Mac only) or Android Emulator

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start

# Run on iOS
npm run ios

# Run on Android
npm run android
```

### Environment Variables

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Add your OpenAI API key and other configuration values
3. Never commit `.env` file (it's already in `.gitignore`)

## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

- **Bug Fixes**: Fix issues reported in GitHub Issues
- **Features**: Implement new features or enhance existing ones
- **Documentation**: Improve README, add code comments, or write guides
- **Tests**: Add unit tests, integration tests, or e2e tests
- **Performance**: Optimize code for better performance
- **Refactoring**: Improve code structure and maintainability

### Contribution Workflow

1. Check existing issues or create a new one to discuss your idea
2. Fork and clone the repository
3. Create a feature branch from `main`
4. Make your changes following our coding standards
5. Write/update tests for your changes
6. Ensure all tests pass
7. Commit your changes with meaningful commit messages
8. Push to your fork and create a Pull Request

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs and complex functions
- Prefer functional components with hooks for React

### File Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/     # Reusable UI components
â”œâ”€â”€ screens/        # Screen components
â”œâ”€â”€ services/       # API and external services
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/          # Utility functions
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/          # Custom React hooks
â”œâ”€â”€ contexts/       # React Context providers
â”œâ”€â”€ types/          # TypeScript type definitions
â””â”€â”€ config/         # Configuration files
```

### Code Style

```typescript
// Good
export const calculateTotal = (items: Item[]): number => {
  return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
};

// Bad
export const calc = (i) => {
  let t = 0;
  for(let x of i) t += x.p;
  return t;
};
```

### Component Guidelines

- One component per file
- Use PascalCase for component names
- Use camelCase for props and variables
- Destructure props in function parameters
- Use React.memo for expensive components

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- MyComponent.test.tsx
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and error cases
- Mock external dependencies

Example test:

```typescript
describe('StorageService', () => {
  it('should store and retrieve API key', async () => {
    const apiKey = 'test-key-123';
    await StorageService.setApiKey(apiKey);
    const retrieved = await StorageService.getApiKey();
    expect(retrieved).toBe(apiKey);
  });
});
```

## Pull Request Process

2. **Lint your code**: Run `npm run lint` to check for style issues
3. **Format your code**: Run `npm run format` to apply consistent formatting
